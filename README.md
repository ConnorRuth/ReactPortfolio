## Description
This is a deployed MVP of my Porfolio website using React

## Installation
You can run this code locally by cloning the repo and run npm i then npm run build which will create a dist folder which can run the whole site as one folder I used Netlify to deploy.

## Usage
Once the page is open you will be at my about me with my face and a description of me, in the top right you will see the nav options you can click on them to navigate through different pages on the site such as my portfolio which will display projects I have previously worked on and clicking on them will send you to the github repository they belong to. if you go to contact you will have a form you can fill out name email and message fields submitting currently only leaves a msg in the client side console. clicking resume you will have a list of some key skills I am proficient in, and a download button for my resume. in the footer is the github logo clicking will take you to my github page.

you can find the deployed site here: https://66497e07da79e867a4b95e96--voluble-buttercream-6d6ecf.netlify.app/
